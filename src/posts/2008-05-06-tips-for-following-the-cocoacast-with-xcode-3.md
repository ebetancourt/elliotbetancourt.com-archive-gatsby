I imagine a lot of programmers out there have similar issues to mine. I meant to learn Cocoa a while back, as a programmer and Apple switcher. But I never got around to it. Fast forward to March 2008, I still haven&#8217;t started learning Cocoa, and now the iPhone SDK comes out! I guess its time to learn!
  
Of course, I first assumed I would just plow through it. I downloaded the first SDK the day it became available, ripped into the sample projects that were online and looked at the code, I honestly could not make heads or tails of a lot of it. I could figure out what code was building the interface elements, and I could see the dummy arrays that were feeding into it, and had a vague idea of most of the syntax (I had programmed in C and C++ but never in Objective-C). No, If I was going to program for the iPhone (and of course all sorts of crazy app ideas were racing through my mind), then I was going to have to properly learn how to program Cocoa and Objective-C.
  
After a bit of googling about, I found the perfect resource:
  
[Cocoacast](http://www.cocoacast.com/) and it used as its Textbook: [â€œCocoa Programming for Mac OS Xâ€ by Aaron Hillegass](http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-2nd/dp/0321213149)
  
It is a very laid back video podcast where the podcaster instructs and screen-casts lessons based on those in the book. It is a very friendl and warm style, but at the same time structured (since it follows the book and has homework), so anyone that wants a college-type environment will find this particular format very enjoyable as well.
  
Of course, I was anxious to learn, so I started following the podcast without first purchasing the book, and noticed that some of the initial dialogs (creating projects and files, etc.) were a bit different, but I managed to follow along.
  
Then in the screencast, he began linking some objects to controls in the window and it was completely different, this was when I realized, that the book and the podcast were written for XCode 2 / 2.5, the latest version (the one that came with the iPhone SDK) was XCode 3! Luckily, Google has all of the answers, and this time, it pointed me to the [publisher&#8217;s website](http://www.bignerdranch.com/products/cocoa1.shtml).
  
I would like to state at this point that I DO plan to purchase the book. However, I am holding out for the version based on XCode 3 (the [3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619)), which should be published on May 26th according to Amazon.
  
I have had very little issue now until I began to follow the exercise regarding a Document-based application. When I created the project, I was greeted by XIB files instead of NIB files. I researched (googled) but no one else had written anything about this. I then decided to install XCode 2.5 on a second computer, and generate an empty document based cocoa application, zipped up my project, and used this as the basis of my exercise. (the RaiseMan exercise).
  
If I was doing something wrong (it IS odd that nothing turned up when I googled things like &#8220;xib vs nib raiseman&#8221;), perhaps selecting the wrong kind of cocoa document-based application project&#8230;please tell me so that I can post a correction to this post.
  
Until I stand corrected, I will assume that other people might run into the same problem. To remedy the situation and help other budding Cocoa Programmers out there, you can download [an empty document-based XCode 2.5 Project](http://www.elliotbetancourt.com/wp-content/uploads/RaiseMan.zip).
