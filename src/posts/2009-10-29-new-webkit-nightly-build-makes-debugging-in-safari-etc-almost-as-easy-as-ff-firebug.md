If you are a web developer that does heavy CSS / Javascript, you have to check out the latest Inspector from the webkit team, its pretty close to the power of firebug.

&nbsp;

its still Beta quality (its only in the nightly builds), and as far as I don&#8217;t know it doesn&#8217;t have a plugin architecture like Firebug. But the bones of it is there:

&nbsp;

Element inspector, CSS display, CSS Editing editing selectors, adding new , live html editing, deleting elements etc.

&nbsp;

A lot of the features were there before, but were not as user-friendly or discoverable. And of course you get the standard Javascript debugging with breakpoints and console, etc.

Read about the improvements here:

&nbsp;

Get WebKit here:

&nbsp;

C&#8217;mon Microsoft, step up your game, IE is way behind the pack here.

&nbsp;

if it wasn&#8217;t for their market share, I would refuse to support IE.
