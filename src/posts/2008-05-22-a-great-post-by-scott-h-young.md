Scott keeps a great blog at www.scottyoung.com, with a lot of excellent observations and advice.&nbsp; In today&#8217;s post he writes about the concept that if you want to develop a new habit, you should commit yourself to mindfully living that habit for 30 days.&nbsp; After 30 days, you can evaluate if that habit works for you or not.&nbsp; Its an awesome post about how you can change your life one step at a time.
