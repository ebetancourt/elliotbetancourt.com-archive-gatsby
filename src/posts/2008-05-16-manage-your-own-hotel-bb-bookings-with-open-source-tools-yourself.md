When my wife and I visited Key West and stayed in a Bed and Breakfast, we talked for a little while about how maybe&#8230;we should just sell everything and move to Key West and open ourr own B & B. Rent bikes, read and hang out. It looks like maybe with this plugin for WordPress, that dream might be a little easier!

    <br /> StayPress is a collection of plugins that will turn a standard vanilla installation of WordPress or WordPress MU into a property management and bookings system. Of course when I say Property, I actually mean any bookable resource of which there is a finite availability. So the StayPress system will be able to manage property rentals, hotel room rentals, conference rooms and centres, B and Bâ€™s, training rooms, bands, etcâ€¦<br /> The new StayPress system takes over from the previous clearskys.net collection of plugins and brings everything together into a more manageable and co-ordinated group.<br /> [From <a href="http://blog.clearskys.net/2008/05/14/introducing-staypress/"><cite>Clearskys.net Blog Â» Blog Archive Â» Introducing StayPress</cite></a>]

Now all we need is: Money to buy a huge place in Key West, and the gumption to do it.
